# Project4-Walkability-Index

### Unveiling Urban Walkability: A Data-Driven Journey

#### Our Quest for Walkability
##### Objective: To decipher the factors contributing to urban walkability, utilizing the EPA SmartLocationDatabase from Data.gov.
We employed RandomForestRegressor as our analytical compass.

#### The Data Map
##### Dataset Overview: A rich repository from the EPA, capturing diverse urban metrics.
Our Focus: 'NatWalkInd' (Natural Walkability Index) as our beacon.

#### Methodology
#### Data Preparation and Analysis
##### We utilized EPA SmartLocationDatabase from Data.gov and focused on the Natural Walkability Index (NatWalkInd) as our target measure.
We removed non-essential variables, standardizing our dataset for optimal analysis.
We identified key features influencing walkability, employing RandomForestRegressor to digest and analyze data.
Engaged RandomForestRegressor with 100 estimators and optimized depth for balanced insights.
We standardized to ensure equal footing among variables.

#### Model Performance and Key Findings
##### We achieved impressive predictive accuracy with an R² of 0.995, showcasing the model’s robustness.
We identified critical factors such as Jobs within 45-minute transit commute (‘D5BR’) and Working age population within 45-minute transit commute as primary influencers of walkability.

#### Summary
##### Our analysis reveals that walkability is significantly influenced by a mix of urban design, density, and accessibility. These insights empower urban planners and developers to craft spaces that prioritize pedestrian accessibility and enjoyment. Provides a data-backed foundation for policies that enhance urban living, focusing on creating walkable, vibrant communities.
